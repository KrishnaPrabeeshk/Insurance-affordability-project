# Insurance-affordability-project
Problem statement : Given a dataset consisting of age affordability and whether or not he/she will buy insurance we have to prdict whether he/she will buy an insurnace . 
example : age=25 ,	affordability(1 means can afford 0 means can't afford) = 0 ,	bought insurance(1 means yes 0 means no) = 0
Idea is to use logisitic regressiononly but implementing it using neural networks . 
I have first used standard library function to implement and also a seperate neural network on my own without using libraries .
